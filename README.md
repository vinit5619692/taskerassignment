# Where to get Docker Compose

### Windows and macOS


Quick Start
-----------

Using Docker Compose is basically a three-step process:
1. Define your app's environment with a `Dockerfile` so it can be
   reproduced anywhere.
2. Define the services that make up your app in `docker-compose.yml` so
   they can be run together in an isolated environment.
3. Lastly, run `docker compose up` and Compose will start and run your entire
   app.
